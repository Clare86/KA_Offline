To view your Khan Academy Program offline: 
If you haven't downloaded the archive through a direct link already, click on the Download ZIP tab on the right side of this web page. 
The archive will automatically pack itself into a ZIP file which will download into your default downloads folder. 
UnZip the file into the folder of your choice. 


Creating your own files for offline viewing is relatively easy if you understand a little basic HTML. 

Copy your Khan Academy Program code and open the file: 
template.js 
using Notepad or your favorite text editor. 

Paste your Program code into the designated area. 
Save As a text only file and name the file 
programName.js 


Now open the Template.html page, scroll down to the bottom, and replace the name that refers to template.js with programName.js . 
You may also change the title of the page etc. if you like. Save As and rename your Template to 
programName.html. 


That should be it :) if you open programName.html in your web browser, you should be able to view your Program offline. 


If you want to make your program portable, or post it on your own website, you need the processing-1.4.8.min.js file, 
your programName.js file and the programName.html file which specifies where to find both of them.
